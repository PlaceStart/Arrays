# Arrays
Place to share PlaceBot (or whatever bot we decide to use) configs/arrays.

This repository is meant to quickly generate reference arrays from all templates pictures in the template folder. By running the script after Template images have been created/updated, the program will create new Array files which can be used by the bot (still needs to be implemented) as reference for placing pixels.

TODO list:

Add upper-left reference positions for all arrays
